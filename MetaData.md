# SQL Practice Project on Meta Data.
It includes the SQL queries during my learning process.

Database link: ```postgres://Test:bQNxVzJL4g6u@ep-noisy-flower-846766.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/DA104.2``` \
It containd 4 tables:
1. ```meta_clients```
2. ```meta_employees```
3. ```meta_offsites```
4. ```meta_revenue```

### Question 1: What is the average annual revenue per sector of clients that work in the sectors Insurance and Banking?
- First we have make sure the data is clean. After looking into the ```sales_team```, ```industry```, ```sector```, and ```region``` column need to be either upper case or lowercase but not the mixed.
~~~~sql
SELECT
	UPPER(sector) AS sector,
  AVG(annual_revenue) AS avg_annual_rev_per_sector
FROM meta_clients
WHERE LOWER(sector) IN ('insurance', 'banking')
GROUP BY UPPER(sector);
~~~~

Output :
| sector    | avg_annual_rev_per_sector |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| BANKING   | 1364.0833333333333        |
| INSURANCE | 355.4166666666667         |


### Question 2: Humberto wants to analyze the marketing spend percentage by country, but the data is not 100% clean. He mentions that you can clean the country field by using the sales team information, and shared the following mapping with you: 
### UK = United Kingdom
### FR = France
### ES = Spain
### IT = Italy
### DACH = Germany
### What is the average marketing spend percentage per country?
~~~~sql
SELECT
  CASE
  	WHEN mc.country IS NULL THEN (
      CASE
      	WHEN mc.sales_team LIKE ('%UK%') THEN 'United Kingdom'
      	WHEN mc.sales_team LIKE ('%FR%') THEN 'France'
    		WHEN mc.sales_team LIKE ('%ES%') THEN 'Spain'
    		WHEN mc.sales_team LIKE ('%IT%') THEN 'Italy'
    		WHEN mc.sales_team LIKE ('%DACH%') THEN 'Germany'
      END
      )
    ELSE mc.country
	END AS upd_country,
  AVG(mc.marketing_spend_perc) AS avg_marketing_spend_perc
FROM meta_clients AS mc
GROUP BY mc.sales_team, upd_country;
~~~~

OUTPUT :
| upd_country          | avg_marketing_spend_perc |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Morocco              | 0.08153846153846155      |
| United Kingdom       | 0.07259999999999998      |
| United Arab Emirates | 0.07307692307692307      |
| Italy                | 0.07279999999999998      |
| Spain                | 0.0716                   |
| France               | 0.07799999999999999      |
| Egypt                | 0.07375                  |
| Germany              | 0.07039999999999999      |
| Israel               | 0.08250000000000002      |


### Question 3: The data seems to be much cleaner now! Humberto is interested in comparing our revenue against the total marketing spend of the clients. What is the total marketing spend in $ (annual revenue of the client multiplied by marketing spend %) and the total revenue generated by Meta per country in 2022? Note: to correctly work with the annual revenue and marketing spend %, you will need to apply an aggregation function to the columns.
~~~~sql
SELECT
	CASE
  	WHEN mc.country IS NULL THEN (
      CASE
      	WHEN mc.sales_team LIKE ('%UK%') THEN 'United Kingdom'
      	WHEN mc.sales_team LIKE ('%FR%') THEN 'France'
    		WHEN mc.sales_team LIKE ('%ES%') THEN 'Spain'
    		WHEN mc.sales_team LIKE ('%IT%') THEN 'Italy'
    		WHEN mc.sales_team LIKE ('%DACH%') THEN 'Germany'
      END
      )
    ELSE mc.country
	END AS clean_country,
	MAX(mc.annual_revenue) * MAX(mc.marketing_spend_perc) AS total_marketing_spend,
  SUM(mr.revenue) AS total_rev
FROM meta_clients AS mc
LEFT JOIN meta_revenue AS mr
	ON mr.client_id = mc.client_id
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM mr.dates) = 2022
GROUP BY clean_country;
~~~~

OUTPUT :
| clean_country        | total_marketing_spend | total_rev          |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| Egypt                | 241.67000000000002    | 56.86926561580709  |
